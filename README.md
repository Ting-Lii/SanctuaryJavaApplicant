The user should be able to register new monkeys into the sanctuary (remember, new arrivals go straight into isolation).
The user should get notified if there is no room for new monkeys (because the isolation cages are full). 
The user should be able to move to the right enclosure monkeys that have received medical attention.
It could produce a list for every enclosure. 
Each enclosure list shows each individual monkey that is currently housed there (for each monkey, include their name, sex, and favourite food) It could produce an alphabetical list (by name) of all of the monkeys housed in the Sanctuary.
